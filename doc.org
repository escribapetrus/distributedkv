#+TITLE: Distributed KV

Implementation of a distributed key-value store. Written in Rust.

* Idea of a complete project

When completed, this program should provide a database deployable in multiple
nodes and accessible through a single API.

In order to make storage permanent, we can store data in disk (write to files)

* Idea of the program development

Let's begin by writing a single node, single program, that stores and retrieves data
from memory.

Then, we can write the store to disk.

Then, we can write the docker deployment.

Then, we can write the distributed part, which I can't even now.



 Let's start with a single node program that stores and retrieves
 key-value pairs in memory. Let's write this in Rust, in two different modules
 for the main entrypoint and the key-value store data structures, and compile it
 to an executable binary.
